## Overview

`soltop` provides real-time monitoring of Solana program activity through an interactive terminal interface. Track transactions per second, compute unit consumption, success rates, and more across all active programs on the network.

### Features

- **Real-time Program Monitoring**: Live tracking of all programs executing on Solana
- **Performance Metrics**: TPS, compute units, success rates, transaction counts
- **Network Overview**: Slot tracking, lag monitoring, aggregate statistics
- **Interactive UI**:
  - Sort by any column (TPS, CU/sec, success rate)
  - Toggle between live and windowed statistics
  - Hide/show system programs (Vote, System, Token programs)
  - Truncate or show full program IDs
- **Customizable**: Choose RPC endpoint, configure monitoring preferences
- **Lightweight**: Low resource usage, runs smoothly in any terminal

```

- **Slot**: Current slot being processed by soltop

- **Window**: Time window for statistics aggregation (5 minutes)
- **Programs**: Number of active programs detected
- **Total TPS**: Aggregate transactions per second across all programs
- **Total Txs**: Total transaction count in the current window
- **Avg Success**: Average success rate across all programs
- **Total CU/sec**: Aggregate compute units consumed per second

### Program Statistics Table

```
┌ Programs ────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Program ID              TPS    Txs   Success  CU/sec    AvgCU│

└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

- **Program ID**: Solana program public key (truncated by default, press `t` to toggle)
- **TPS**: Transactions per second for this program
- **Txs**: Total transaction count in the window
- **Success**: Success rate percentage
- **CU/sec**: Compute units consumed per second
- **AvgCU**: Average compute units per transaction

```

### How It Works

1. **Data Collection**: Polls Solana RPC endpoint every 400ms for new slots
2. **Parsing**: Extracts program invocations and compute unit usage from transaction logs
3. **Aggregation**: Maintains rolling window of statistics using ring buffers (5-minute window)
4. **Rendering**: Updates TUI at ~10fps with cached statistics

The application uses a **producer-consumer** pattern:

- **Producer task**: Continuously fetches new slots from the RPC endpoint
- **Consumer task**: Processes slot data and updates program statistics
- **UI task**: Renders the terminal interface with cached stats

## Performance Considerations

- **RPC Load**: Each soltop instance makes approximately 2-3 RPC requests per second
- **Memory Usage**: ~10-50MB depending on number of active programs
- **CPU Usage**: <5% on modern systems
- **Network Bandwidth**: ~100KB/sec

**Recommendation**: Use a dedicated RPC endpoint or rate-limited public endpoint for production monitoring. Public RPC endpoints may throttle requests.

## Known Limitations

- **Platform Support**: Currently Linux x86_64 only (macOS and Windows support planned)
- **Distribution**: Binary releases only (crates.io publication planned for future release)
- **Navigation**: Keyboard navigation in program list (up/down arrows) not yet implemented
- **Compute Units**: Some programs may not emit detailed logs, resulting in incomplete CU metrics

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Issues

If soltop fails to connect to the RPC endpoint:

```bash
# Test RPC endpoint accessibility
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"getSlot"}' \
  https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com
```

If the endpoint is unreachable, try a different RPC provider or check your network connection.

### High CPU Usage

- Ensure you're using a responsive RPC endpoint with low latency
- Public endpoints may have rate limits causing retries and increased CPU usage

### Program Not Appearing

- Some programs may not be active in the current monitoring window
- System programs are hidden by default (press `u` to show them)
- Very low-activity programs may not accumulate enough transactions to appear in rankings

### Terminal Display Issues

- Ensure your terminal supports UTF-8 and has a minimum width of 80 characters
- If colors appear incorrect, try a different terminal emulator

- [ ] **Alert thresholds**: Notifications when programs exceed thresholds
- [ ] **Keyboard navigation**: Scroll through program list with arrow keys
- [ ] **Multiple themes**: Dark, light, and custom color schemes
- [ ] **RPC connection pooling**: Better performance with multiple endpoints
- [ ] **Integration tests**: Comprehensive testing with mock RPC
- [ ] **Configuration file**: Save preferences in ~/.config/soltop/config.toml
