### Added
- Initial public release of soltop
- Real-time Solana program monitoring via terminal UI
- Interactive terminal UI powered by ratatui
- Network overview panel displaying:
  - Current slot and network slot with lag tracking
  - Uptime and monitoring window duration
  - Total TPS, transaction count, and average success rate
  - Total compute units consumed per second
- Program statistics table showing:
  - Program ID (with truncation toggle)
  - Transactions per second (TPS)
  - Total transaction count
  - Success rate percentage
  - Compute units per second
  - Average compute units per transaction
- Keyboard controls:
  - `q` - Quit application
  - `t` - Toggle program ID truncation
  - `u` - Toggle system program visibility
  - `w` - Toggle view mode (Live vs Window)
- Command-line options:
  - `--rpc-url` - Custom RPC endpoint URL
  - `--hide-system` - Hide system programs by default
  - `--verbose` - Enable verbose performance statistics

- Async/await implementation with tokio runtime

### Technical Details
- Rust 1.75+ required
- Linux x86_64 binary distribution
- RPC polling interval: 400ms per slot
- Statistics window: 5 minutes (750 slots)
- Memory usage: ~10-50MB
- CPU usage: <5%
- Network bandwidth: ~100KB/sec

### Known Limitations
- Platform support limited to Linux x86_64 (macOS and Windows support planned)
- No crates.io distribution yet (GitHub releases only)
- Keyboard navigation in program list not implemented
- Compute unit metrics may be incomplete for programs without verbose transaction logs
